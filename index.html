        <p>
          The Tequendama waterfall is a natural waterfall in Colombia, located
          in the municipality of Soacha in the department of Cundinamarca.
        </p>
        <p>
          The geographical environment of this waterfall is located in the
          mountainous areas of Tequendama and Canoas that separate the savannah
          of Bogota from the lower valley of the river of the same name through
          which runs the high Andean forest and its waters fall from
          approximately 157 meters over a rocky abyss of circular shape.
          Administratively, it belongs to the villages of Canoas and San
          Francisco of Corregimiento 2 of the municipality of Soacha. Part of
          its waters are also fed by the overflow of the Muña River dam.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a Muisca myth, it was formed by the divine action of
          Bochica, a god or civilizing hero, who taught the Muiscas to spin
          cotton and weave blankets, in addition to instilling moral and social
          principles, according to the mythical tradition that he created the
          Tequendama waterfall with an accurate blow of his staff to evacuate
          the waters that flooded the savannah of Bogota.

        <p>
          The municipality and its inhabitants had just begun to discover it at
          the hands of the urbanization that preceded the industrial development
          of the 1950s. The enormous excavations that were carried out to build
          large industrial emporiums began to unearth the archaeological and
          ancestral wealth of Soacha.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first human remains of the Cundiboyacense plateau were found
          there, in the rock shelters of Tequendama. Pictograms, zoomorphic and
          anthropomorphic stones have been found on the enormous rocks that have
          witnessed the growth of Soacha. Until the 70's there were 35 rocks
          with rock art, today there are barely five due to mining exploitation.
